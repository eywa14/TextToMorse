# TextToMorse

TextToMorse is a simple program written in python that can turn any text into Morse code, after the standards for International Morse Code. 

## Installation

The Project is build in Python version 3.12.
After you downloaded or cloned the Repo, go into **TextToMorse** (if you download as zip it's **TextToMorse - master**) directory.
It is recommended to create a **virtual environment** like this:


```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

<hr>
Then activate the virtual environment.

- On Linux/MacOs:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

- On Windows:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

<hr>
In the venv now use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you are ready to go and run:
```bash
python main.py
```

<hr>
Ps.: After usage deactivate the venv like this:

```bash
deactivate
```
